   <h2 id="osi-model">OSI Model</h2>
	<p>The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a telecommunication or computing system into seven distinct layers. Each layer serves a specific purpose and interacts with the adjacent layers, allowing for efficient communication between devices on a network.</p>
    <h2 id="different-types-of-network">Different Types of Network</h2>
    <p> Networking can be categorized into various types based on their geographic scope and usage. Some common types include local area networks (LANs), wide area networks (WANs), and metropolitan area networks (MANs).</p>

   <h2 id="lan-network">LAN Network</h2>
    <p> A LAN (Local Area Network) is a network that covers a small geographic area, typically confined to a single building or campus. LANs are commonly used in homes, offices, and schools to connect devices like computers, printers, and servers.</p>

 <h2 id="wan-network">WAN Network</h2>
    <p> A WAN (Wide Area Network) is a network that covers a large geographic area, often spanning across cities, countries, or even continents. WANs are used to connect multiple LANs and facilitate long-distance communication.</p>
    <h2 id="internet">Internet</h2>
    <p> The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers and servers that allows users to access and share information across the world. It operates on a combination of various networking technologies and protocols.</p>

<h2 id="mac-address">MAC Address</h2>
    <p> A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) of a device. It is used at the data link layer of the OSI model to ensure data is delivered to the correct device within a local network.</p>

   <h2 id="what-is-an-ip-address">What is an IP Address</h2>
    <p>An IP (Internet Protocol) address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves as an identifier to locate and route data between devices on both local and global networks.</p>

  <h2 id="private-and-public-address">Private and Public Address</h2>
    <p>IP addresses can be classified as private or public. Private IP addresses are used within a private network, such as a LAN, and are not directly accessible from the internet. Public IP addresses, on the other hand, are assigned to devices directly connected to the internet.</p>

 <h2 id="ipv4-and-ipv6">IPv4 and IPv6</h2>
    <p>IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) and IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) are two different versions of the IP protocol. IPv4 is the older and more widely used version, while IPv6 was developed to address the exhaustion of available IPv4 addresses and provide additional features.</p>

 <h2 id="localhost">Localhost</h2>
    <p>The localhost refers to the loopback network interface, usually identified by the IP address 127.0.0.1. It is used to test network communications on an individual device without involving any external network.</p>
    
  <h2 id="tcp-and-udp">TCP and UDP</h2>
    <p>TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two of the most commonly used transport layer protocols in networking. TCP provides reliable, connection-oriented communication, while UDP offers faster but unreliable, connectionless communication. </p>
    <h2 id="tcpudp-ports-list">TCP/UDP Ports List</h2>
    <p>TCP and UDP use port numbers to identify specific applications or services running on a device. A port number is like an address used to direct data to the right application. This section provides a list of commonly used TCP and UDP port numbers.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-pingicmp">What is Ping/ICMP</h2>
    <p>Ping is a utility used to test the reachability of a host on a network and measure the round-trip time for data to travel from the source to the destination. ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is the underlying protocol used by Ping to send echo request and receive echo reply messages.</p>

   <h2 id="positional-parameters">Positional Parameters</h2>
    <p>Positional parameters are variables used in shell scripts and command-line interfaces to accept arguments provided by the user when executing a script or command. These parameters are referred to by their position, starting with $1 for the first argument, $2 for the second, and so on.</p>
