    <p>This repository contains code examples and explanations for various networking concepts. Below, you will find a
        brief overview of each concept covered in this repository.</p>

  <h2>Concepts Covered</h2>

  <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>What is localhost?</h3>
            <p><code>localhost</code> is a hostname that refers to the current device used to access it. It is used to
                access the network services that are running on the host via the loopback network interface. The
                loopback interface bypasses any local network interface hardware.</p>
        </li>
    <li>
            <h3>What is 0.0.0.0?</h3>
            <p><code>0.0.0.0</code> is a special IP address that typically represents "all addresses" or "any address"
                in the context of networking. When a server or application binds to <code>0.0.0.0</code>, it listens on
                all available network interfaces, allowing it to accept connections from any IP address.</p>
        </li>

   <li>
            <h3>What is the hosts file?</h3>
            <p>The <code>hosts</code> file is a local operating system file that maps hostnames to IP addresses. It is
                used to override the DNS (Domain Name System) lookup, allowing users to specify custom IP address
                associations for specific domain names. This file is commonly used to block or redirect certain
                websites locally.</p>
        </li>

   <li>
            <h3>Netcat Examples</h3>
            <p>Netcat, often abbreviated as <code>nc</code>, is a versatile networking utility that allows for reading
                from and writing to network connections using TCP or UDP protocols. It can be used for port scanning,
                transferring files, and other network-related tasks. This repository contains various examples
                showcasing how to utilize Netcat effectively.</p>

  <h2>How to Use the Repository</h2>

 <p>To explore the code examples and explanations, navigate through the repository's directories. Each concept is
        organized in its separate folder, and within each folder, you will find relevant code files and a README
        providing further details and instructions on using the code examples.</p>

 <h2>man or help</h2>

 <p>The repository also includes information on the usage of some relevant commands. You can access the manual (man)
        pages or help for the following commands:</p>

 <ul>
        <li><code>ifconfig</code>: This command is used to configure and display network interfaces on Unix-like systems.
            It shows the current configuration of all network interfaces, such as IP addresses, MAC addresses, and
            more.</li>

   <li><code>telnet</code>: Telnet is a network protocol used to establish a remote terminal connection to a host
            over a TCP network. It allows users to interact with the remote system's command-line interface as if they
            were directly connected to it.</li>

  <li><code>nc</code> (Netcat): Netcat is a versatile networking utility that can read from and write to network
            connections using TCP or UDP protocols. It can be used for port scanning, transferring files, and many other
            networking tasks.</li>

 <li><code>cut</code>: The <code>cut</code> command is used to extract sections from lines of input (files or
            standard input). It can be used to manipulate and display specific fields or columns from the input data.
        </li>
    </ul>

  <p>Please refer to the relevant man pages or use the <code>help</code> command with the respective utility for more
        information on their usage.</p>
